# NeuralNetwork - Scratch
A MNIST Neural Network created without libraries, just numpy.
---
When I was entering the world of AI, I wanted to dig deep into it: how did it work, what algorithms does it use, ...
So I searched, learnt and ultimately made an MNIST model using just numpy, to really understand what was going on under the hood of the model.
Most of the work is inspired in 3Blue 1Brown and Samson Zhang.
